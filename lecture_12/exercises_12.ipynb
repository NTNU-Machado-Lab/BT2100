    " - Go to [MetaboAnalyst](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/)\n",
    " - Click Start and choose *Statistical Analysis (one factor)*\n",
    " - Upload the *csv file* (you need to download it from jupyter to your computer first)\n",
    " - In the normalization step tick *Autoscaling*\n",
    " - Press *normalize* and *view results* (discuss what is happening)\n",
